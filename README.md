# WordPress Plugin - WordPress Firewall Re

This WordPress plugin monitors various web requests to your site in order to timely identify and stop the most obvious malicious attacks. 

This is an updated and modified version of the once popular WordPress Firewall plugin by SEO Egghead, with some bug fixes, adaptation to the latest versions of PHP and WordPress. The general view has also been slightly changed, help has been added, multilingualism and other little things that make working with the plugin more convenient.

This plugin for WordPress monitors all incoming web requests to the site using a simple heuristic analysis, detects and prevents the most common attacks. It is worth noting that there are many similar solutions that perform similar tasks; but they don't always install on fresh versions of WordPress, don't always work as they should, and are often just hard to install and configure. What can not be said about this plugin.

The WordPress Firewall Re plugin independently maintains a whitelist and blacklist, with descriptions of potential violators, depending on what kind of suspicion they cause. Its purpose is not to replace blog updates, protection and control by the site owner, but rather to mitigate some attacks, to give you the opportunity to take some measures to protect the site.


#### This version works on PHP version – 8.1 and WordPress 6.1


### Installation Plugin

1. Download the archive with the plugin file
2. Unzip to a folder convenient for you, the contents of the archive
3. Upload the plugin file "wordpress-firewall-re.php" to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

The setup doesn't have to be complicated. Moreover, after activating the plugin, you can leave everything as it is or, if you wish, set your own settings.

In the "Apply security filters" block, you can leave everything as it is.

In the "When an attack is detected" block, select the behavior when an attacker is detected. You can either redirect it to a 404 error or redirect to the main page of the site. After making changes, just click on the "Set security filters" button, the settings will be saved.

In the "Email" block, you can specify the email address where notifications will be sent. Again, you can not specify the mail. If the mail is specified, when your site is attacked, notifications will be sent to it, with information about the attack and the attacker. It happens that the site starts to be crawled by the bot, and hundreds of letters begin to arrive in the mail, in order to avoid this, there is an option “Do not send the same type of warning letters”, which can be enabled.

The language used in the plugin is set automatically based on the locale of the site, which is set in the general WordPress settings block. If you have Russian enabled, the text will be in Russian, otherwise it will be in English. To keep the plugin view as a single file, the translation is included in the plugin.
